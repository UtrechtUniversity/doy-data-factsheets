impact their physical, social-emotional, and cognitive development. In the long run, children with a chronic disease reach developmental milestones later than their healthy peers and many children will remain dependent on medication and/ or will be limited in their daily life activities.<br><br>The PROactive Cohort Study aims to assess fatigue, participation, and psychosocial well-being across children with various chronic diseases over the course of their lifespan since their increased vulnerability is a fact. These factors have the potential to influence their identity and how they grow into autonomous adults that take part in our society. Also the PROactive Cohort Study is aimed at supporting people with chronic and/or life-threatening conditions to increase their ability to adapt, and their self-manage capacities. This means that PROactive also systematically monitors the child's capacity and ability to play and the well-being of the patients and their families. This knowledge can be used as an innovative and interactive method for creating prevention and treatment strategies. This will help to assess vulnerabilities and resilience among children with chronic and/or life-threatening conditions and their families.<br><br>This cohort study follows a continuous longitudinal design. It is based at the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital in the Netherlands and has been running since December 2016. Children with a chronic disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, chronic kidney disease, or congenital heart disease) in a broad age range (2-18 years) are included, as well as their parent(s). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are collected from parents (children between 2-18 years) and children (8-18 years). The PROactive Cohort Study uses a flexible design in which the research assessment is an integrated part of clinical care. Children are included when they visit the outpatient clinic and are followed up annually, preferably linked to another outpatient visit.<br><br>(2021-05-07) |\n|Subject               |Medicine, Health

This means they cannot view each others' responses, but researchers can easily link these users during data export. Participants complete the questionnaires at home, on a computer. The estimated time participants need to complete all questionnaires was 30-45 minutes for a baseline or extended assessment and 15-20 minutes for a core set assessment. |\n|Actions to Minimize Losses                   |If a questionnaire is not completed, the project team contacts the families twice per email and once per telephone. In case of no response, these attempts are repeated at their next outpatient clinic visit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|Cleaning Operations                          |We check for, and remove, doubled patients or doubled responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|Response Rate                                |In March 2021, the response rate for the baseline questionnaires was 69% and the follow-up questionnaire ranged from 61%-83% (for the total sample, not specific to disease groups).

Please use the data citation shown on the dataset page. Custom Dataset Terms — the following Custom Dataset Terms have been defined for this dataset.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|Terms of Use                |The data are sensitive since they involve personal information of patients. There are also restrictions on use by commercial parties, and on sharing openly based on (inter)national laws and regulations and written informed consent. Therefore these data (and additional clinical data) are only available upon signing a Data Sharing Agreement (see Terms of Access) and within a specially designed environment provided by the UMC Utrecht.                           |\n|Confidentiality Declaration |Depending on who the recipient is and where they are located, a Data Use Agreement or Data Transfer Agreement in line with GDPR regulations will have to be signed. Consortium Agreements are also a possibility in the case of collaborations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|Special Permissions         |The data request form has to be completed when requesting the data. Furthermore, the pre-publication checklist has to be followed prior to submission of a manuscript. Both of these can be found in the Data Access and Publication Guidelines. Note that PhD candidates or other students cannot request the data independently, but only in consultation with their supervisor(s).                                                                                         |\n|Restrictions                |It is important to note that the PROactive team does not consider overlap in research questions when evaluating data requests. The data cannot be used for purposes other than what it was specifically requested for and it cannot be further shared or distributed. The researchers will be responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the data. The restrictions that apply to the dataset will be outlined in the Data Use Agreement or Data Transfer Agreement. |\n|Citation Requirements       |We encourage researchers to include “PROactive Cohort Study” either as keyword or as corporate author on publications. We also ask researchers to include an acknowledgment on behalf of PROactive Cohort Study, this text can be found in the Data Access and Publication Guidelines. If possible, we also ask the PROactive Cohort Study logo in combination with the WKZ logo to be used in all communication materials.                                                   |\n|Conditions                  |All projects requesting PROactive Cohort Study data should be appropriately funded and sustainable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n\n\n## Restricted Files + Terms of Access\n\n\n\n\n|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Data Access Place   |Accessing the data may require utilizing the Digital Research Environment at the University Medical Center Utrecht or SURFfilesender for a secure data transfer.                                                                                                                                     |\n|Availability Status |Documentation and information regarding the dataset can be found on DataverseNL, but the dataset itself is not publicly available for download, as it contains sensitive personal data. The data will only be delivered when a data request is approved and all the necessary agreements are signed. |\n|Study Completion    |This is an ongoing study, so there isn't a complete dataset.
