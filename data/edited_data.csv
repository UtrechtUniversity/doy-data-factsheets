"4","PROactive cohort study",NA,"This cohort aims to assess fatigue, daily life participation, 
and psychosocial well-being as primary outcomes across 
children with various chronic condition from childhood to 
early adulthood. Clinical assessments as well as patient- and 
proxy-reported biological, psychological, and social factors 
are used as determinants. We distinguished the determinants 
as predisposing, direct stressors or mediating factors and 
considered which of these factors could be a possible treatment target.
Furthermore, the PROactive cohort study identifes children at high risk of debilitating fatigue, decreased daily life 
participation and psychosocial problems, as well as children 
who are more resilient and thrive despite the challenges of 
growing up with a chronic condition. The PROactive cohort 
study lays a foundation for improving clinical care for children with a chronic disease and their families, and embedded design studies: following children, adolescents and 
adults with a chronic disease over time in order to monitor 
them and ofer tailored assistance when needed to help them 
grow up as ‘healthy’ as possible. This knowledge can be 
used as an innovative and interactive method for creating 
new group or personalized prevention and treatment strategies. To our knowledge, there are no cohorts that collect 
data longitudinally, across various paediatric chronic conditions measuring risk and protective factors and outcomes in 
a similar, transdiagnostic way across diseases in both child 
and parents.",NA,"S.L. Nijhof","Longitudinal cohort"

demonstrate whether and how mixed language input affects children's language development;
determine the influence of social, linguistic and cognitive factors on children's language mixing behaviour;
identify the impact of Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) on the relation between mixed language input and children’s language development; and
elucidate the effect of DLD on children's language mixing behaviour.","Utrecht University","Elma Blom, WBT","Longitudinal cohort"

"15","SMART-Youth","SMART-Youth: Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial diseases in the Young with a chronic condition","Introduction: Cardiovascular risk assessment and management in the pediatric population is relatively unchartered territory. Atherogenesis yet starts during childhood, making childhood and adolescence an important window of opportunity to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) later in life. This holds especially for children with various chronic conditions who are at increased risk of early ASCVD as a result of disease- and lifestyle-associated cardiovascular risk factors. This paper describes the rationale, design and methods for the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial diseases in the Young with a chronic condition (SMART-Youth) study. This study aims to identify disease- and lifestyle-associated risk factors of preclinical atherosclerosis in children with a chronic condition. The results of this study will assist in tailored cardiovascular risk assessment and management in children at-risk.
Methods and analysis: This is a Dutch prospective, longitudinal cohort study including children aged 8-18 years with various chronic conditions (cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease, primary immunodeficiency, autoinflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, congenital heart disease, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, and children with unexplained medical symptoms). Preclinical atherosclerosis is assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Measurements are performed at baseline, with 2-year follow-up assessments. Recruitment runs from August 2024 until February 2029 with an estimated final sample of 1350 children. Regression-based methods will be used to examine the association of cardiovascular risk factors and preclinical atherosclerosis, and a mixed effect model is used to investigate this association over time. 
Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval was granted by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht (NL84874.041.23). Written informed consent by participants and their parents is required for participation. Collected data will be made available to researchers upon reasonable request. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, and presentations at scientific meetings.
