Childhood and adolescence thereby provide a unique window of opportunity to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) later in life, especially for pediatric groups at risk. The growing list of pediatric groups at risk includes chronic inflammatory disorders, organ transplant recipients, familial hypercholesterolemia, endocrine disorders, childhood cancer survivors, chronic kidney diseases, congenital heart diseases, fetal growth restriction, and premature birth, next to increasing numbers of children and adolescents with traditional risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. The best way to assess cardiovascular health in the pediatric population is relatively unchartered territory. Multisite and multimodal assessment of early atherosclerosis emerged as the best way to capture the complexity of atherosclerosis as a systemic disease. Next to conventional carotid intima-media thickness measurements, implementation of aortic pulse wave velocity and endothelial function measurements can advance the assessment of early atherosclerosis in pediatrics.Objective: The primary objective of this study is to establish the effect of disease and lifestyle associated cardiovascular risk factors on preclinical atherosclerosis in children with a chronic condition, and follow this up over time.Study design: The SMART-Youth study is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study including children with various chronic conditions followed up in the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital.Study population: Children with various chronic conditions who are enrolled in the PROactive study, within the age range of 8-18 years. The study will include the following chronic conditions: cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease, primary immunodeficiency, autoinflammatory conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, and congenital heart disease, as well as children with a history of premature birth or fetal growth restriction, and children with persistent somatic symptoms.

In the long run, children with a chronic disease reach developmental milestones later than their healthy peers and many children will remain dependent on medication and/ or will be limited in their daily life activities.The PROactive Cohort Study aims to assess fatigue, participation, and psychosocial well-being across children with various chronic diseases over the course of their lifespan since their increased vulnerability is a fact. These factors have the potential to influence their identity and how they grow into autonomous adults that take part in our society. Also the PROactive Cohort Study is aimed at supporting people with chronic and/or life-threatening conditions to increase their ability to adapt, and their self-manage capacities. This means that PROactive also systematically monitors the child’s capacity and ability to play and the well-being of the patients and their families. This knowledge can be used as an innovative and interactive method for creating prevention and treatment strategies. This will help to assess vulnerabilities and resilience among children with chronic and/or life-threatening conditions and their families.This cohort study follows a continuous longitudinal design. It is based at the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital in the Netherlands and has been running since December 2016. Children with a chronic disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, chronic kidney disease, or congenital heart disease) in a broad age range (2-18 years) are included, as well as their parent(s). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are collected from parents (children between 2-18 years) and children (8-18 years). The PROactive Cohort Study uses a flexible design in which the research assessment is an integrated part of clinical care. Children are included when they visit the outpatient clinic and are followed up annually, preferably linked to another outpatient visit.(2021-05-07)\n\n\nSubject\nMedicine, Health and Life Sciences; Social Sciences\n\n\nKeyword\nChild Health (MeSH)\n\n\n\nChronic Disease (MeSH)\n\n\n\nLifecycle Paediatrics\n\n\n\nBiopsychosocial Model (MeSH)\n\n\n\nPROactive\n\n\nRelated Publication\nder Vlist, M.

The participants are all residents in the Netherlands.\n\n\nTime Method\ncross-sectional, longitudinal\n\n\nFrequency\nYearly\n\n\nSampling Procedure\nParticipants are screened for inclusion into the study when visiting the outpatient clinic. If included, the children and their parents complete questionnaires on psychosocial functioning. These questionnaires are primarily utilized within the context of clinical care, but they are used in scientific research if consent is provided for the same.\n\n\nCollection Mode\nonline questionnaires (KLIK; https://www.hetklikt.nu/)\n\n\nType of Research Instrument\nStructured, with some open-ended questions.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Data Collection Situation\nParents and children have their own user profiles for the questionnaires. This means they cannot view each others’ responses, but researchers can easily link these users during data export. Participants complete the questionnaires at home, on a computer. The estimated time participants need to complete all questionnaires was 30-45 minutes for a baseline or extended assessment and 15-20 minutes for a core set assessment.\n\n\nActions to Minimize Losses\nIf a questionnaire is not completed, the project team contacts the families twice per email and once per telephone. In case of no response, these attempts are repeated at their next outpatient clinic visit.\n\n\nCleaning Operations\nWe check for, and remove, doubled patients or doubled responses.\n\n\nResponse Rate\nIn March 2021, the response rate for the baseline questionnaires was 69% and the follow-up questionnaire ranged from 61%-83% (for the total sample, not specific to disease groups). Currently, we have 5 years’ worth of data."

There are also restrictions on use by commercial parties, and on sharing openly based on (inter)national laws and regulations and written informed consent. Therefore these data (and additional clinical data) are only available upon signing a Data Sharing Agreement (see Terms of Access) and within a specially designed environment provided by the UMC Utrecht.\n\n\nConfidentiality Declaration\nDepending on who the recipient is and where they are located, a Data Use Agreement or Data Transfer Agreement in line with GDPR regulations will have to be signed.

Furthermore, the pre-publication checklist has to be followed prior to submission of a manuscript. Both of these can be found in the Data Access and Publication Guidelines. Note that PhD candidates or other students cannot request the data independently, but only in consultation with their supervisor(s).\n\n\nRestrictions\nIt is important to note that the PROactive team does not consider overlap in research questions when evaluating data requests. The data cannot be used for purposes other than what it was specifically requested for and it cannot be further shared or distributed.

The data will only be delivered when a data request is approved and all the necessary agreements are signed.\n\n\nStudy Completion\nThis is an ongoing study, so there isn’t a complete dataset. Twice a year we carry out a ‘data lock’ where all data collected in the previous 6 months are added to the larger dataset."
